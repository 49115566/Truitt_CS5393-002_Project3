1. Design the data structures for the sentiment analyzer.
This data structure should store the number of positive sentiments and the total number of tweets each word appears in.
Use a Trie to reference the words.
Each node in the Trie should have a dynamically sized hash table (similar to a Python dict) to store links to child nodes.

2. Implement the Trie data structure.
Each node in the Trie will represent a character in a word.
Nodes will contain a hash table to store links to child nodes.
Each node will also store two counters: one for the number of positive sentiments and one for the total number of tweets containing the word up to that node.

3. Create functions to insert words into the Trie.
When inserting a word, traverse the Trie character by character.
If a character node does not exist, create it and initialize the counters.
Update the counters appropriately based on the sentiment of the tweet.

4. Develop a function to calculate sentiment scores.
Traverse the Trie to find the node corresponding to the last character of the word.
Use the counters stored in the node to calculate the sentiment score for the word.
The sentiment score can be the ratio of positive sentiments to the total number of tweets containing the word.

5. Optimize the hash table in each node.
Ensure that the hash table dynamically resizes to maintain efficient operations.
Consider using a load factor to determine when to resize the hash table.

6. Test the data structure with sample data.
Create a set of sample tweets with known sentiments.
Insert the words from these tweets into the Trie and verify that the counters and sentiment scores are accurate.

7. Analyze the performance of the Trie.
Measure the time complexity of insertion and lookup operations.
Evaluate the memory usage of the Trie with different sizes of input data.
Identify any potential bottlenecks and suggest optimizations.

8. Extend the sentiment analyzer to handle negations.
Implement logic to detect negations in tweets (e.g., "not happy" should be treated differently from "happy").
Adjust the sentiment scores accordingly.

9. Add support for different languages.
Modify the Trie to handle characters from different languages and scripts.
Ensure that the sentiment analysis works correctly for multilingual tweets.

10. Implement a user interface for the sentiment analyzer.
Create a simple web or command-line interface to input tweets and display sentiment scores.
Allow users to visualize the sentiment analysis results.

11. Document the code and create a user manual.
Write detailed comments and documentation for each function and data structure.
Create a user manual explaining how to use the sentiment analyzer and interpret the results.
